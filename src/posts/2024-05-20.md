#### Creating a tiny init in rc

**DISCLAIMER**: I take no responsability if you attempt to use this, and end up with a broken system.
Always remember to do your own research. Also: Have fun.

Today, we will do a writeup on creating a small init, and init scripts, but opposed to writing them in `bash` or POSIX `sh`, we will write it in `rc`.  
Despite `rc` not being specified by [POSIX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX), we will still try to avoid any non-POSIX utilities, so that our scripts remains as portable as possible.

What is [`rc`](http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/4th_edition/papers/rc) you say?  
`rc` is the shell (or command interpreter to be correct) used by [plan9](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_9_from_Bell_Labs).  
`rc` has since been ported to various OS's, like Linux, and BSD's.
In comparisson to more mainstream shells like [`bash`](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) or [`ksh`](http://kornshell.com/), `rc` is a lot smaller.  
This might imply that `rc` *lacks* features, but this is a feature, not a bug.

Lets also give a crude explenation of the boot process of a Linux system:
1. Bootloader starts, which loads up the kernel (On UEFI systems, this is optional with the use of [efistub](https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/efi-stub.html)).
2. kernel starts, and calls the init (by call, we mean run, or start).
3. init starts and calls your initscript
4. login prompt should now be present and the OS has finished its boot process.

Anyway, lets get on with it, and create a simple init for linux.  
Lets start with the actual init, which might located as `/bin/init`, depending on your system.  
The init is the OS's first process to start. (Also refered to as PID 1 (Process ID 1)).  
If your init is not PID 1, something is wrong, and the init should exit with an error.

So, the first thing your init probably should do, is check wether its PID 1 or not.  
In `rc` it can look something like this:  

	#!/bin/rc  
	test $pid -eq 1

In `rc`, `$pid` is a special variable, which contains the PID of the running process.  
In `bash` and other shells, the equivalant would be `$$`.

Next on the list would be to exit, should [`test`](http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/test.html#top) not give us a exit code of 0.  
We then append; `|| exit 1` at the end of our script, and it should now exit, if `test` returns a non-zero value. (0 here is true, and >0 is false)  
The numerical value after exit, is called an [exit code](http://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/V3_chap02.html#tag_18_08), and everything >0, is considered an error.
Now we should have somthing like this:  

	#!/bin/rc  
	test $pid -eq 1 || exit 1

Now that our init has checked if its PID is 1, we can now call our initscript.  
Initscripts is not to be confused with the init, as they're different componets of the init system.  
The initscripts job for the most part be to mount your drives, and start your service manager.
Initscripts can in a lot of cases do a lot more than this, but in this scenario, everything else is superflous.  

Moving forward, we can append now `/etc/rc.init`, so that our init can start the initscript.  
Your initscript might be located elsewhere, or named something else.  
(I.e. Kiss Linux has them located in `/lib/init/rc.boot`)

Our init should now look like this:  

	#!/bin/rc  
	test $pid -eq 1 || exit 1  
	/etc/rc.init

Now our init has done more or less everything its supposed to.
The boot process will now continue with our initscript (`/etc/rc.init`)
But before we move on to write our own initscript, we would need to make sure that our init does not exit.

To avoid our init to exit, we will use a while loop, acompanied by the [`wait`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/wait.html#top) command and our previously mentioned `$pid` variable.
We will use `while()` which is the equivalant of `while :` on regular shell (in this case both `()` and `:` is interpreted as [*true*](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/true.html#top)).  
This means that aslong as the value is true (which it is, and always is), the loop will continue.  
An infinite loop if you will.
We will then run `wait $pid`, this will wait for `$pid` to exit. Which doesnt occour.

Our inits final form can now look something like this:

	#!/bin/rc
	test $pid -eq 1 || exit 1
	/etc/rc.init
	wait(){wait $pid)}

We now have a init in measly 3 lines of code. Which is pretty small, even in comparisson to other small inits like [`sinit`](https://git.suckless.org/sinit), which is just shy of 100 LOC. Although, `sinit` is written in C, and not `rc`.

Now for the initscripts;
We will start with `/etc/rc.init`, which is the part which is ran during the boot process.
Our `/etc/rc.init` might look something like this:

	#!/bin/rc
	umask 022
	
	mkdir -p /dev/pts
	mkdir -p /dev/shm

	mount -t proc none /proc
	mount -o remount,rw /
	mount -a

Lets run through them and give a brief explenation what they do:

- `umask 022`
  - [`umask`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/umask.html#top) sets the default permissions across the system in general.
    - Usually this is set in `/etc/profile`, but here it is set because `/etc/profile` has yet to take effect.
      - However, `rc` does not read from `/etc/profile`, so even if `/etc/profile` had taken effect at this point, `rc` would remain unaffected.
    - There is also commands being ran here which is affected by our `umask` value.
    - Most distrobutions set 022 here, so that all users can read and execute all newly created files.
      - [Arch wiki](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Umask) has a write-up on what the numerical values means.
- `mkdir -p /dev/pts`
  - We need to create this directory, as it seems the kernel doesnt do this for us.
  - This creates the space for psuoedo-terminal interfaces we need for our system to work
    - see [pts(4)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/pts.4.html) and [pty(7)](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/pts.4.html) for more details
    - We then mount this later with our [`/etc/fstab`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man5/fstab.5.html) as [devpts](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man4/pts.4.html).
- `mkdir -p /dev/shm`
  - We need to create this directory, as it seems the kernel doesnt do this for us.
  - `/dev/shm` is later mounted as `tmpfs` (as listed in `/etc/fstab`), and houses temporarly files.
- `mount -t proc none /proc`
  - We need to mount `/proc` prematurly, even though its listed in `/etc/fstab` to be mounted later.
  - We cant successfully boot our system without it.
- `mount -o remount,rw /`
  - Remount root partition with read-write permissions.
  - When booting, the kernel will mount root partition with read-only.
- `mount -a`
  - Mount all partitions according to your `/etc/fstab`

At this stage, we should now have a successfully booted system.
However, for the keen eyed among you, who might be asking yourself:

> *Where is my login prompt?*

This is correct. We have yet to start any `getty`'s.
We could append `/bin/getty /dev/tty1 linux` to our initscript, and have login prompt ready for us.
However, if you log out, or type in the wrong password, `login` would not give you a new login prompt, and youd be stuck with a blinking prompt.

This is because we have to run the command in a `while` loop, or using a service manager giving us the same functionality.
Using a service manager for this  gives you more granual control over how many `getty`'s you wish to run. Be it 2, or 12.  
Chances are youd likely to be wanting to run atleast 2 tty's anyway, to have a way out, should your GUI freeze up on you.

Now that we have a working init, and initscript for booting up, we can now turn to how to properly shutdown our machine.
Obviously we could just rip out the powercable, or force the computer of, but we dont wanna mess up our partitions now do we?  
Our `/etc.rc.shutdown` can look something like this:

	#!/bin/rc
	
	kill -s TERM -1
	sleep 1
	kill -s KILL -1
	
	swapoff -a
	
	mount -o remount,ro /
	sync
	
	umount -a
	
	wait
	
	switch($1) {
	case -p
		halt -p
	case -r
		halt -r
	}

Again, lets run through what they mean, and why theyre there.

- [`kill`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/kill.html#top) `-s TERM -1`
  - send TERM signal to all PIDs above PID 1. (with the -1 flag. -1 is not however not specified by POSIX)
  - an alternative would be to use [`killall5`](https://linux.die.net/man/8/killall5).
  - `killall5` is unfortunatly also not specified by POSIX.
- [`sleep`](https://pubs.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/9699919799/utilities/sleep.html#top) `1`
  - We need to wait a bit, so that programs can properly terminate on their own.
- `kill -s KILL -1`
  - This is the same command as above, but instead of `TERM`, we send `KILL` signal instead.
  - This is mostly to stop any leftover processes still running
- `mount -o remount,ro /`
  - We now remount our root partition with read-only permissions.
- `sync`
  - We need to syncronize the disk(s), so that any unwritten data is getting written to disk, to avoid data loss.
- `umount -a`
  - Now umount all disk according to `/etc/fstab`
- `wait`
  - Wait for all running processes within the script to finish, before we move any further.
- and last:

	switch($1) {
	case -p
		halt -p
	case -r
		halt -r
	}

- Here we have the commands to actually poweroff, or reboot the machine.
- I use [`halt`]( https://linux.die.net/man/8/halt) from [ubase](https://git.suckless.org/ubase/), made by [suckless](https://suckless.org/)
- `halt` in our case will **imediately** shut down your machine, so its important for disks to have been properly unmounted before we run this, so we avoid data loss
- `halt` is unfortunatly also not specified by POSIX

Unfortunatly our `rc.shutdown` script is in a less ideal state due to non-POSIX tootls.  
Another alternative, would be to write a portable script in C, like [Oasis Linux](https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis/blob/master/pkg/sinit/shutdown.c) does.

At this point, we now have a way to boot our machine, aswell as shut it down properly.
I Hoped this peaked your interest, maybe you learned something new, or made you look into some of these topics.
