So, you've stumbled upon my website.


Some things I like:
- Linux, or Unix-like systems in general.
  - Noteably [KISS Linux](https://kisslinux.org), [Oasis Linux](https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis), aswell as other small, niche distros.
  - I also maintain my own system in [Oakiss](https://github.com/hovercats/oakiss), a mix between Oasis, and KISS. 
- Software minimalism/simplicity, aswell as portability and correctness
- Programming and scripting.
  - I mostly script in rc, or POSIX sh.
  - Im also trying to learn C and lua, but Im lazy, so it takes forever.
