<p>I have several notable projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/rcinit">rcinit</a>
<ul>
<li>a really small init script, written in plan9's rc shell</li>
<li>inspired by <a href="https://github.com/cemkeylan/shinit">shinit</a>, <a href="http://core.suckless.org/sinit">sinit</a> and the like, I really wanted to</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>write one in rc instead
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/shsm">shsm</a>
<ul>
<li>I really wanted to get rid of busybox's runit, and have a service manager</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>written in POSIX sh.
  - I then found <a href="http://r-36.net/scm/svc/log.html">svc</a>, which was (mostly) exacly what I was looking for,
although, with some flaws. So I made (what I would call) improvements
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/rcsm">rcsm</a>
<ul>
<li>Superseeding shsm, I wanted to step up my game from rcinit, and write</li>
</ul>
<p>something a bit more complicated than rcsm.
<ul>
<li>based on the same idea as shsm, I put together a service manager i roughly</li>
</ul>
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>half the size of shsm.
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/kiss-dumpsterfire">kiss-dumpsterfire</a>
<ul>
<li>my KISS repo, which hosts just about all of the packages on my system.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
