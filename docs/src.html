<p>I have several notable projects:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/rcinit">rcinit</a>
<ul>
<li>a really small init script, written in plan9's rc shell</li>
<li>inspired by <a href="https://github.com/cemkeylan/shinit">shinit</a>, <a href="http://core.suckless.org/sinit">sinit</a> and the like, I really wanted to write one in rc instead</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/shsm">shsm</a>
<ul>
<li>I really wanted to get rid of busybox's runit, and have a service manager written in POSIX sh.</li>
<li>I then found <a href="http://r-36.net/scm/svc/log.html">svc</a>, which was (mostly) exacly what I was looking for, although, with some flaws. So I made (what I would call) improvements</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/rcsm">rcsm</a>
<ul>
<li>Superseeding shsm, I wanted to step up my game from rcinit, and write something a bit more complicated than rcsm.</li>
<li>based on the same idea as shsm, I put together a service manager i roughly half the size of shsm.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/hovercats/oakiss">oakiss</a>
<ul>
<li>my custom OS, based on <a href="https://github.com/oasislinux/oasis">Oasis Linux</a> with <a href="https://codeberg.org/kiss-community/kiss">KISS</a> on top.</li>
</ul>
</li>
