I have several notable projects:

	- <a href="https://github.com/hovercats/rcinit">rcinit</a>
		- a really small init script, written in plan9's rc shell
		- inspired by <a href="https://github.com/cemkeylan/shinit">cemkeylan/shinit</a>, <a href="http://core.suckless.org/sinit/">sinit</a> and the like, I really wanted to
		write one in rc instead
	- <a href="https://github.com/hovercats/shsm">shsm</a>
		- I really wanted to get rid of busybox's runit, and have a service manager
		written in POSIX sh.
		- I then found svc, which was (mostly) exacly what I was looking for,
		although, with some flaws. So I made (what I would call) improvements
	- <a href="https://github.com/hovercats/rcsm">rcsm</a>
		- Superseeding shsm, I wanted to step up my game from rcinit, and write
		something a bit more complicated than rcsm.
		- based on the same idea as shsm, I put together a service manager i roughly
		half the size of shsm.
	- <a href="https://github.com/hovercats/kiss-dumpsterfire">kiss-dumpsterfire</a>
		- my KiSS repo, which hosts just about all of my packages on my system.
